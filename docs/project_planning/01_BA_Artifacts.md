# HishamOS - BA Agent Artifacts
## 1. Project Scope Document

**Project Name**: HishamOS (AI Agent Operating System)
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-11-30
**Prepared by**: Business Analyst Agent

---

### 1. Executive Summary
HishamOS is a comprehensive, AI-powered operating system designed to orchestrate a team of 15 specialized AI agents. It aims to automate the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC) and business operations, transforming vague ideas into fully deployed products with minimal human intervention. The system integrates with major AI platforms (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) and provides a unified interface for managing complex workflows, ensuring high quality, security, and efficiency.

### 2. Project Objectives
1.  **Full Automation**: Automate 90% of routine SDLC tasks (coding, reviewing, testing).
2.  **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate 15 specialized agents to work collaboratively.
3.  **Platform Agnostic**: Support seamless switching between OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini.
4.  **Quality Assurance**: Enforce strict quality gates at every stage (Dev → Review → QA).
5.  **Security**: Implement enterprise-grade security (RBAC, 2FA, Vault).

### 3. Scope Definition

#### 3.1 In-Scope Items
*   **Core System**: Workflow Engine, Agent Dispatcher, Command Executor.
*   **Agents**: 15 Agents (Coding, Reviewer, Legal, PM, QA, etc.).
*   **Interfaces**: Web Dashboard, Admin Panel, CLI.
*   **Integrations**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Jira, Slack, GitHub/GitLab.
*   **Data**: PostgreSQL Database, Redis Caching, Vector DB (for memory).
*   **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD Pipelines.
*   **Project Management**: AI-driven Sprint/Story management.

#### 3.2 Out-of-Scope Items
*   Hardware manufacturing or IoT device management.
*   Operating system kernel development (it runs *on* an OS, it is not a kernel).
*   Offline-only mode (requires internet for AI models).

### 4. Success Criteria
*   System successfully executes a "Idea to Code" workflow without error.
*   Response time for agent dispatch < 200ms.
*   Support for concurrent execution of 50+ workflows.
*   Zero critical security vulnerabilities in audit.

## 3. Business Requirements Document (BRD)

### 1. Business Problem
Current software development is fragmented, manual, and prone to human error. Coordinating between PMs, Developers, and QA is slow and costly.

### 2. Proposed Solution
HishamOS acts as a "Virtual Software House," automating the coordination and execution of tasks using specialized AI agents.

### 3. ROI Analysis
*   **Cost Reduction**: Estimated 60% reduction in development costs by automating routine tasks.
*   **Time to Market**: 3x faster delivery of features due to 24/7 AI operation.
*   **Quality**: Consistent code quality enforced by strict AI review protocols.

### 4. Business Rules
*   **BR-01**: No code is deployed to production without passing the AI Code Reviewer and AI QA Agent.
*   **BR-02**: All AI costs must be tracked and attributed to specific projects/departments.
*   **BR-03**: Human approval is required for "Critical" priority deployments.

### 5. Risks
*   **AI Hallucination**: Mitigated by "Self-Critique" loops and multi-agent verification.
*   **API Costs**: Mitigated by budget limits and caching strategies.
